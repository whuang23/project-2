    <h2>Intro to HFAI</h2>
    <p>Established in 2004, The Automation Institute Robot Club from Affiliated High School of South China Normal University (SCNU) aimed to advance technology development. Thanks to the constructions of several years' students, the AI robot club owns the biggest activity area at the school now and has over 20 members as well.</p>

   </div>
    <p>Our target is to develop students' interests in robots and skills for physical jobs as well as innovations.</p>
  
    <p>Also, we not only study robot knowledge formally, but also learn how to play with robots.

</p>
    <p>In the school organizations' exhibition day, we exhibited many innovative robots with funny structures which perform tasks like walking, obstacle avoidance and Automatic Intelligence robots soccer games. You can fight with AI robots with a game controller. But the most interesting thing is writing the “smart” program as an AI programmer in order to make AI robots win the game all the time! Besides, we participate in many competitions in our city and province, even across the country and the world. As a school team member, you can win the world wild prize only if you do well in our club.</p>
    <p>If you already have a strong engineering or programming ability, come and join us as soon as possible. The sky is the limit.</p>
    <p>New students are welcomed as well, you will learn something you can't get from a text book through practice and rigorous ways to think.</p>
    <p>Join us, and seize the opportunity to realize your aspiration.</p>
    <p>Here's your stage!</p>
