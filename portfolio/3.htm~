    <h2>Ramble</h2>
    <p>There are only couple days left to the final exam in our high school. At this time, I’d like to thank my parents. I'm not prideful about my parents, but I just want to express my parents’ love in this page.</p>
    <p>In the past 5 months, my father has stayed with me almost every night no matter how busy he was. In fact, my father only has a bachelor's degree and he had tasted all this hardship in senior high shool in China a long time ago. But he has still stayed with me and helped me fight with the ocean of questions, hearing my story about how we despaired in mathematics, how English Literature kills students as well as how ignorant we were in Chinese Literature. Besides, he would have a big argument with me when I made some mistakes or ambiguous responses. I really enjoyed this kind of love from my father and his rigorous attitude to knowledge. What’s more, I really want a lazy Sunday but my father often knocks on my door at 8 am. I might be angry first but am shocked when I think more about my father: How can my father get up early everyday? He needn’t do that. My father’s persistence impresses me.</p>
    <p>And regarding my mother, she is a meticulous housewife, even just my sneeze can pull her out of bed and rush her to my room. She is an expert at cooking. I can’t stop eating her various kinds of Chinese cusine. In other words, she is my advisor at life. Recently, I found that the skin on her cheeks and around her eyes was beginning to wrinkle. But she never even mentioned that. I feel more and more nervous as I don’t know if I can provide her a better life. Besides that, she is also a link between me and my father. When I argued with my father, she was the first person to mediate the dispute. She must be the most important person in my life.</p>
