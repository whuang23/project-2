    <h2>Bygone</h2>
    <p>Today, I am returning, to that road, to that shop. I see my shadow on this road and the bygone past was salvaged little by little.</p>
    <p>Do you remember? Stepping on the long road, the destination was my primary school. I was wearing my ink spotted uniform and a tiny school bag, grabbing a coin from the corner of my house, thinking of tasty snacks, going to school with satisfaction and being caught by the principal for sneaking in late. What still remains now? Nothing!</p>

    <p>Today may be the annual opening day for parents. Lots of students are leaving school with their parents, heading to their homes. Those active and naughty kids sometimes rush far away from their parents, only returning when their parents’ call, sometimes begging their parents for a new toy. But their parents are just talking about the scores of those rascals. There may be a strict father, followed by his sad-looking son, who is checking the exam paper. Maybe there is a happy mother holding a reward certificate. But it’s time to face the truth, these good days do not belong to me anymore. I’m staring at the slogan printed on the primary school building blankly, forgetting the time.</p>
    <p>“You are proud of Chao Tian Primary School today. We are proud of you tomorrow.”</p>
    <p>I don’t know if those bygone days can remind me of a good memory all the time, but I'm pretty sure that tomorrow will come in one day.</p>
