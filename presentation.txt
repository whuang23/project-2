		good evening everybody. it's my pleasure to show you my project2 formaly here.
		as you guys seeing, this is my index page contains 4 grids: the title, navigation bar content and footer. this 4 divs are the main framework in my website and you will see those grids in all other page.
		for the title grid,also call header, is make up with a logo picture and a h1 tag sentence. With the tips from Professior,it looks well with a css proportry : clear:both.
		about the navigation bar, contains 3 tags Resume, Portfolio and about me tags. brown backgound and white font color.
		next is content grid. In index page, i divide content into 2 sub grid which has the consideration for moblie devices. when you zip the width and you can find that those two sub grids stand from paralle to one by one style. 
		what is interesting is i use a little tricky things to make my index page more huminity. you can hide the datill by clicking the brown bar.(i add tips here so every one can easily find this javaScript.
