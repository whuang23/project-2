    <h2>Intro to HFAI</h2>
    <p>Established in 2004, The Automaton Institute robot club from Affiliated High School of SCNU (South China Normal University) aimed at advance technology development. Thanks for constructions of several years' students, the AI robot club owns biggest activity area all over the school now and over 20 members as well.</p>
    <p>Our target are developing students' interests of robots and skills of physical jobs as well as innovations.</p>
    <p>Also, we not only study for the robot knowledge formally but also learn how to play with robots.
