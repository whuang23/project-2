    <h2>We are “smilence” * about the championship</h2>
    <p>It was November 7, an uncommon day, when we participated in the Robot football game competition in Hong Kong. Although we didn’t win the first prize, as the third place, we are smilence about the championship. You may wonder why we did this. All right, let me tell you the story.</p>
    <p>In this competition, we participated in 2vs2 robot football competition. Actually there were 20 teams in 5 groups at this competition. The rules are like real soccer, the difference is the players are robots without a controler, which means we must have not only the good hardware but also good software. In fact, the robot soccer isn’t testing the robot but ourselves.</p>
    <p>We can describe the first group game as “super easy”. The games are always decited at the 3rd minute and they end with a landslide victory. It was funny once our opponent had to get all their robots off the court to debug the software. As a strategy, we got one robot off and set the other to the lowest power, which made that robot seem like it was rambling on the court. However, as the only team from the Chinese main land, we were “taken care of” by the referee. For example, the voltage of this game is restricted to less than 14V. The problem is our robots’ power seemed bigger than others, so the referee tested our battery again and again. We paid no attention to this kind of test until we found those tests were a pitfall in the afternoon.</p>
    <p>When we finished the 8 to 4 game and prepared for the semifinal with confidence, we found we might lose in the next game because our power supply board was broken. What made us despair was our robot was totally fastened and it would take a long time to replace a new power supply board. After we finished replacing the board, the game score went from 4 to 0 to 6 to 10, we lost the game! We were about to cry when we saw the worst robot team going to finals court. Yuck!</p>
    <p>After we examined the broken power supply board, we figured out the reason why it was broken: the referee’s incorrect testing method made the battery short circuit. So we had a argument with the referee but we couldn't reverse the fact that we lost the game.</p>
    <p>Anyway, we have no regret about Hong Kong. We were the best team in this competition and we are smilence about the first place.</p>
    <p>*smilence  = smile but remain silent, an oral Chinese expression that means somebody just laughs but doesn’t say anything to explain why he laughs.</p>
