    <h2>We are “smilence” * to the championship</h2>
    <p>It was November 7, a uncommon day,when we participated the Robot football game competition in Hong Kong. Although we didn’t win the first prize, as the third place,we are smilence to the championship. You may wander why we did this. All right, let me tell you the story.</p>
    <p>In this competition, we participated in 2vs2 robot football competition. Actually there were 20 teams in 5 groups at this competition. The rules are almost the same to real soccer, the difference is the players are robots with out a controler, which means we must have not only the good hardware but also the good software. In fact, the robot soccer isn’t testing the robot but ourselves.</p>
    <p>In the first group game,we can describe the game with “Wicked sick”. The game always came into garbage time at the 3rd minute and end with a landslide victory. It was funny once our opponent had to get all their robot off the court to debug the software. As a strategy, we got one robot off and set the other to the lowest power, which make that robot seem like ramble on the court. However, as the only one team from Chinese main land, we were “token care” by the referee. For example, the voltage of this game is restricted to less than 14V. The problem is our robots’ power seems bigger than others, so the referee tested our battery again and again. We paid no attention to this kind of test until we found those tests were pitfall in the afternoon.</p>
    <p>When we finish the 8 to 4 game and prepared for semifinal with confidence, we found we might lose in next game because our power supply board was broken. What made us despaired is our robot was totally fasten and it would take a long time to replace a new power supply board. After we finished replacing the robot, the game score went from 4 to 0 to 6 to 10, we lost the game! We were about to cry when we saw the worst robot team going to finials court. Yuck!</p>
    <p>After we exam the broken power supply board,we figured out the reason why it was broken is the referee’s wrong testing method made the battery into short circuit. So we had a argument with referee but we can’t reverse the fact that we lost the game.</p>
    <p>Anyway,we have no regret in Hong Kong, we are the best team in this competition and we are smilence to the first place.</p>
    <p>*smilence  = smile but silence ,a oral Chinese words that means somebody just laugh but don’t say anything to explain why he laugh.</p>
