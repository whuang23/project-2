    <h2>Ramble</h2>
    <p>There are only couple days left to the final exam in our high school. In this time, i’d like to thank my parents. I m not pride of my parents,but I just want to express my parents’ love in this page.</p>
    <p>In the pass 5 months, my father almost stay with my every night no matter how busy he was. In fact, my father has only a bachelor ‘s degree and he had tasted all this hardship in senior high shool in China long time ago. But he still stay with me and help me fighting with the ocean of questions,hearing my story about how despaired we were in mathematica kills students, how English Literature kills students as well as how ignorant we were in Chinese Literature. Besides,he would have a big argument with me when I made some of mistakes or ambiguity. I was really enjoyed this kinds of love from my father and his rigorous attitude to knowledge. What’s more, I really want a lazy Sunday but my father often knocks my door at 8 am. I might be angry but shocked when I had a deep though on my father: How can my father gets up early everyday? He needn’t to do that. My father’s persistence impress me so far.</p>
    <p>And talking about my mother, she was a meticulous housewife even a sneeze of mine can pull her off the bad and rush to my room. She is an expert at cooking. I can’t stop eating her various kind of Chinese cusine. In other word, she was my advisor of living. Recently, I found that the skin on her cheeks and around her eyes was beginning to wrinkle. But she never even mention that. I feel more and more nervous as I don’t know if i can provide her a better live. Besides, she was also a link between me and my father. When I argued with my father, she was the first person to mediate the dispute. She must be the most important person in my life. That’s it!</p>
