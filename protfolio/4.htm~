    <h2>Bygone</h2>
    <p>Today, I am return, to that road, to that shop. I see my shadow on this road and bygone was salvaged little by little.</p>
    <p>Do you remember? stepping on the long road and the destination is my primary school. I was wearing my ink spotted uniform and a tiny school bad, grabbing a coin from the corner of my house,thinking of tasty snacks, going to school with satisfy and being caught by principal. What do I still remain now? It’s nothing!</p>
    <p>Today may be the annual opening day to parents. Lots of students are leaving school with their parents,heading to their home. Those active and naughty guys sometimes rushing far away from there parents and back with their parents’ recall, sometimes bagging their parents for a new released toy. But their parents are just taking about the scores of those rascals. There may be a strict father,followed by his sad-looking son ,who is checking the exam paper or a happy mother holding a reward certificate. But it’s time to face the truth, these good days are not belong to me anymore. I’m staring the slogan printed on the primary school building blankly,even forget the time.</p>
    <p>“You are proud of Chao Tian Primary School today. We are proud of you tomorrow.”</p>
    <p>I don’t know if those bygones can remind me a good memory all the time, but I ‘m pretty sure that tomorrow will come in one day.</p>
