    <h2>Bygone</h2>
    <p>Today, I am return, to that road, to that shop. I see my shadow on this road and bygone was salvaged little by little.</p>
    <p>Do you remember? stepping on the long road and the destination is my primary school. I was wearing my ink spotted uniform and a tiny school bad, grabbing a coin from the corner of my house,thinking of tasty snacks, going to school with satisfy and being caught by principal. What do I still remain now? It’s nothing!</p>
    <p>Today may be the annual opening day to parents. Lots of students are leaving school with their parents,heading to their home. Those active and naughty guys sometimes rushing far away from there parents and back with their parents’ recall, sometimes bagging their parents for a new released toy. But their parents are just taking about the scores of those rascals. There may be a strict father,followed by his sad-looking son ,who is checking the exam paper or a happy mother holding a reward certificate. But it’s time to face the truth, these good days are not belong to me anymore. I’m staring the slogan printed on the primary school building blankly,even forget the time.</p>
    <p>In the school organizations exhibition day, we exhibited oceans of innovation robots with its funny structure like walking, obstacle avoidance and Automatic Intelligence robots soccer games. You can flight with AI robots with a game controller. But the most interesting thing is writing the “smart” program as a AI programmer in order to make AI robots win the game all the time! Besides, we participate in many competitions in our city and province even the whole country ,what's more, The Robo Cup Junior(RCJ). As a school team member, you can win the world wild prize only if you do well in our club.</p>
